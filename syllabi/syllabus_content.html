<h5 id="lecture-1-preliminaries">Lecture 1: Preliminaries</h5>
<p>The objective of the first lecture is to overcome the coefficient of static friction in using R for data science. Students will learn to execute simple R scripts to read, write, and extract data elements.</p>

<h5 id="section-2-data-analysis-modeling">Section 2: Data Analysis + Modeling</h5>
<p>The use case drives the technique. In public policy, data can be used to support evaluation of programs to understand causal mechanisms (e.g. retrospective focus) or enable the creation of data-rooted products that drive action (e.g. deployed applications). Machine learning and data analysis enables both uses of data and will be the focus of the next five courses</p>
<h6 id="lecture-4-introduction-to-supervised-learning">Lecture 4: Introduction to Supervised Learning</h6>
<p>Supervised learning is the most relied upon class of techniques that enable causal inference but also deployed precision policy. How does changing one variable independently impact another variable? We begin to introduce basic regression analysis, correlation coefficients, ordinary least squares, and the relationship between the concepts. Note that this is a very cursory review, and the deep assumptions are not tested or expounded upon.</p>

<h5 id="lecture-5-simulations-selection-bias">Lecture 5: Simulations, selection bias</h5>
<p>Formal statistics offers methods to calculate closed-form, analytical answers to the limits of OLS regression.

<p>No, this is not an independent study session. Unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and principal components analysis helps to identify recognizable patterns when no labels are provided. In sales and recruitment offices, customer segmentation may use current customer data, then use clustering techniques to identify k-number of distinct customer profiles. In resourceful law firms, data scientists may develop topic modeling algorithms to automatically tag and cluster hundreds of thousands of documents for improved search. This session will focus on clustering methodologies that are commonly employed in applied research.</p>

<h4 id="section-3-data-enhancement-and-visualization">Section 3: Data enhancement and visualization</h4>
<p>Beyond the data preparation and modeling, the ‘presentation layer’ is the glue that will allow a data science project stick with target audiences. Often times, presentation is graphical and relies upon a rich ecosystem of visualization, web services, and interactive applications to communicate pertinent issues.</p>
<h5 id="lecture-9-data-storytelling-through-graphical-representation">Lecture 9: Data storytelling through graphical representation</h5>
<p>Often times, the model is not enough to communicate the value of the data analysis. A well-designed visualization can illustrate patterns and allow target audiences to establish a connection with the analytical effort at hand.</p>

<h5 id="lecture-10-web-service-apis-and-spatial-data">Lecture 10: Web service APIs and spatial data</h5>
<p>There are many cases where you will rely on data or services that aren’t stored or build on your local machine, but rather are exposed as web service application programming interfaces (APIs). These are the components of modern software development, and we will teach how to find and utilize these services from within the R programming environment. We use this lecture as an opportunity to introduce spatial data within R by interacting with an API for geographic data.</p>

<p>The state of data is rapidly expanding in two principal directions: transactional-level and spatially. Maps are the principal mode of representing spatial data, which relies upon different types of GIS formats (e.g. shapefiles, raster, GeoJSON) and presentation medium. This lecture dives into spatial considerations in data science.</p>
